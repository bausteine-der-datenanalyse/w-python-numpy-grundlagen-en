## Exercise 1 {.unnumbered}

A rectangular concrete beam is subjected to a uniformly distributed load along its length. The stress distribution along the length of the beam shall be analyzed. The beam has a length of 10 meters, a width of 0.3 meters, and a height of 0.5 meters. The uniformly distributed load is 5000 N/m.

1. Create a NumPy array `x` with 100 evenly spaced points along the length of the beam from 0 to 10 meters.

2. Calculate the bending moments $M(x)$ along the length of the beam using the formula:
$$
M(x) = \frac{w \cdot x \cdot (L - x)}{2}
$$
where $w$ is the distributed load (in N/m), $x$ is the position along the beam (in m), and $L$ is the length of the beam (in m).

3. Compute the maximum bending stress $\sigma_{\text{max}}(x)$ at each point along the beam using the formula:
$$
\sigma_{\text{max}}(x) = \frac{M(x) \cdot c}{I}
$$
where $c$ is the distance from the neutral axis to the outermost fiber of the beam (in m), and $I$ is the moment of inertia.  
The moment of inertia of a rectangular cross-section is given by:
$$
I = \frac{b \cdot h^3}{12}
$$
where $b$ is the width (in m) and $h$ is the height of the beam (in m).

4. Determine the maximum bending stress.

5. Plot the stress distribution $\sigma_{\text{max}}(x)$ along the length of the beam.
